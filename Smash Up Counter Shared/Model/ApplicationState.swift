/*
 The class ApplicationState manages the state and the data (the players and the available add-ons) of the entire application.
 
 The singleton pattern is used to limit the occurences of objects from this class to one. This singleton is accessible
 from anywhere into the application.
 
 Each property of this class is an Observable. Then every controller can subscribe to these observable properties and update
 its view if needed.
 
 This class is composed of multiple extensions, each of these extensions provide methods concerning the management of its properties.
 Its properties must not be changed directtly, but the use of the methods are encouraged.
